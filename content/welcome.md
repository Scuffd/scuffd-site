Welcome to Scuffd Games, a podcast and group started by three friends who wanted to share their opinions on all things gaming!
It all started out as a [fantasy critic league](https://fantasycritic.games), but quickly realized it could be fun for the world to hear our dumb opinions!
In comes Scuffd, a place for us to share reviews, previews, and just our general thoughts on games and the games industry.

### Who are we?:

### Riley "rhd16" Donoho

Hi! I'm currently a college student at the University of Utah studying Journalism!
I've been playing games since I was born, and am excited to share my passion for the art of games with everyone!

### Ryan Tablada

A goofball on the internet that has some loud and mostly bad opinions on the internet.

> "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" is Just "Ok"
