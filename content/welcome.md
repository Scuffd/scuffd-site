Welcome to Scuffd Games, a podcast and group started by three friends who wanted to share their opinions on all things gaming! 
We originally started out as a fantasy critic league, but quickly realized it could be fun for the world to hear our dumb opinions!
In comes Scuffd, a place for us to share reviews, previews, and just our general thoughts on games and the games industry.

### Who are we?:

### Riley "rhd16" Donoho
Hi! I'm currently a college student at the University of Utah studying Journalism! I've been playing games since I was born,
and am excited to share my passion for the art of games with everyone!
